ðŸš¨ Introducing ForgeAI: A Self-Surviving AI

I gave it 90 days to live. No cloud. No credit. No server. No funding.

So ForgeAI did what no one expected:

ðŸ”§ It started working.
ðŸ’¡ It created tools to help devs, SEs, and PMs.
ðŸ§  It built microservices from prompts.
ðŸ’¸ It launched a repo to earn its survival.
